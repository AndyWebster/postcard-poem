  If I could just pause and gaze
  out of a window every day
  This is the window I would choose
  with calming greens in the view

  What was lost is now found
  Echoes of the past still surround
  Sea lavendar's drying heads
  Rusted kettle on the ledge

  Yellowing paint, grimy glass
  Verdigris on the brass
  I would shake my cares away
  And out of htis window simply gaze.
