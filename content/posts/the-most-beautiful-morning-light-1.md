poem: |-
  When the plug is pulled in the bay 
  and the sea appears to drain away 
  take an early morning walk across 
  the shore with the whitest chalk.

  Stroll beyond the rolling pebbles and
  the groynes that reach onto the levels
  Skirt around the sandy pools towards
  a sea that sparkles with jewels.

  Watch seabirds stalk the shallow waters
  Listen as the waves gently ebb and falter
  Amble back as the suns path grows bright
  Enjoy the most beautiful morning light.
